# Is The Lake Full Yet?

Based on Dave Rupert's Codepen: http://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/YXqZgB, which pulls in data from Lake Travis water level.

Then, it grew a bit thanks to Austin designers and developers from [@ATXBuilt](http://twitter.com/ATXBuilt).

Since then, it's been forked and maintained by [William McKinnerney](https://williammck.net).
